# Sales-Forecasting---with-Facebook-Prophet-Model-

This report looks at store and sales data for Rossmann drug stores, a large drug store chain that operates several thousand stores all across Europe (Rossmann Store Sales, 2015). It looks at data covering more than a thousand stores, with information ranging from store model, distance from competitor stores, to promos currently running. It also looks at the number of customers and number of sales for each store on a daily level over a period of more than two and a half years. Throughout the report weâ€™ll merge, clean, and wrangle this data so we can easily filter down to look for trends in sales and customer numbers across different types of stores and over different time periods. Through this exploratory analysis we hope to identify trends across all stores and across stores based on their unique characteristics, with the hope of using said trends to be able to predict future sales
